! This file should be run as an argument to
! xmodmap at the startup of your working
! environment. The actual command is:
! `xmodmap .xmodmaprc`
! To make it effective on OS startup the
! above line needs to be added to .xinitrc
!
! Main purpose of this remapping is to allow
! ratpoison WM to use CapsLock as it's 
! escape sequence.
!

! Exchaning caps lock for F13
!clear lock
!keycode 66 = F13
clear Lock
